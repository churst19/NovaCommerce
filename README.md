# What is this site?

This is an ecommerce site built using MongoDB, Express, React, node.js, and Stripe. You can create an account and log in, add things to your cart, remove them, empty your cart, and checkout using stripe.
**Note:** To use this website, it does not require you to use a real email address or verify it, so you can easily create a new user and look at the website. However, an account has no purpose at this time beyond creating a user, logging in, and logging out. Future updates will add the ability to save cart information, order history, and user information beyond an email/password.
_To test a successful checkout, use card number 4242 4242 4242 4242_
